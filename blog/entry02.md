Since my first post about trading, I’ve learned a lot more about the technology that traders use, and I’ve realized how important both software and hardware are. Software includes trading platforms and tools that help traders analyze the market and make trades, like MetaTrader or ThinkorSwim. Hardware, on the other hand, involves things like powerful computers and fast internet that make sure everything runs smoothly and quickly. Good software won’t work well without the right hardware, and powerful hardware needs the right software to be useful. For serious traders, keeping both updated and working well is important to stay competitive in fast-moving markets.
<br>
<h2>Software</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Trading Platforms</strong>: The main software I use for trading is a trading platform, like <strong>Tradingview or MetaTrader 5.</strong> These platforms let me track stock prices, view charts, and place orders all in one place. I’ve been using <strong>Tradingview</strong> because it’s beginner-friendly, free to use, and gives me access to charts, market data, and even paper trading, which lets me practice without using real money. <strong>MetaTrader 5,</strong> on the other hand, is a more advanced platform that offers a lot of features for experienced traders. It gives me real-time data, which is key when I need to make quick decisions. Platforms like TradingView and MetaTrader 5 and more (according to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/">Investopedia</a>) are popular because they give traders the tools they need to stay updated and execute trades efficiently.
</li>
  <li><strong>Charting Tools</strong>: One thing I’ve learned is how to use <strong>charting tools</strong> to analyze stock prices. <strong>Candlestick charts</strong> show how the price of a stock moves over time, and they help me spot patterns. I’ve also started using <strong>Candlestick charts</strong> like moving averages and <strong>RSI (Relative Strength Index)</strong> to predict if a stock might go up or down. These tools are really helpful for making better decisions when I’m picking stocks to trade. According to articles I found on <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/">Investopedia</a>), these tools are commonly used by traders because they give clear signals about whether to buy or sell a stock.
</li>

  <li><strong>News Feeds & Alerts:</strong> Another thing that helps is the news feed on trading platforms. It shows breaking news about the economy or specific companies, and I can see how that news affects stock prices. I can also set <strong>alerts</strong> to notify me when a stock reaches a certain price or when something important happens. This way, I don’t have to constantly check the market. I read that setting up alerts is crucial for active traders because it helps them stay on top of their trades without wasting time.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Computers & Laptops:</strong> To use these platforms effectively, I need a <strong>fast working computer</strong>. Trading software uses a lot of data, especially when I’m looking at charts and monitoring multiple stocks at once. If my computer is too slow, I could miss an opportunity. A good <strong>processor</strong> and enough<strong>RAM</strong> make everything run smoothly.For example 256-512GB and 16+ GB RAM would be a great start. I’ve learned from YouTube videos that professional traders usually go for computers that can handle multiple programs at the same time without lagging.</li>

  <li><strong>Multiple Monitors:</strong> Many traders use <strong>multiple monitors</strong> to keep track of several things at once, like watching charts, news, and their trades all at the same time. I only have one monitor right now, but I plan to get another one soon. With a second screen, I could keep one monitor for stock charts, one for news, and another for tracking trades. Having more than one monitor helps traders stay organized and makes it easier to follow everything at once.
</li>

<li><strong>Internet Connection:</strong> A fast, reliable <strong>internet connection</strong> is crucial for trading. If my connection is slow, I might miss out on a good trade or experience lag when I place orders. A strong internet connection ensures I can see real-time data and place trades without delay</li>
</ul>

<h2>Source</h2>
<P>I found a lot of helpful information from reliable sources like <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/">Investopedia</a> and <a href="https://www.schwab.com/td-ameritrade">TD Ameritrade</a>, where experienced traders share their knowledge. For example, <strong>Investopedia</strong> offers in-depth articles on the best trading platforms and tools, helping me understand the features I should look for in software. I also looked into the <strong><a href="https://www.metatrader5.com/en">MetaTrader5</a> platform from <strong>TD Ameritrade</strong>, which provides resources and training for both beginner and advanced traders.</p>
<br>
<h2>Engineering Design Process (EDP)</h2>
Right now, I feel like I’m in the <strong>"testing and refining"</strong>. I’ve been practicing using the platforms, studying charts, and learning about the different indicators. But I still feel like I need more practice before I feel fully confident to start investing real money. This is like how you would test and refine a project to make sure everything works before moving to the next phase. I’ve spent a lot of time understanding how the platforms work and what tools I need to improve my strategies. I also need to practice more with different indicators and tools to see what works best for me. The next step will be testing everything on a demo account and refining my strategies until I feel ready for real trades.
<br>
<h2>Skills</h2>
Over the last few weeks, I’ve developed a few skills that are helping me get better at trading:
Chart Analysis: I’ve learned how to read and understand candlestick charts and technical indicators like the RSI and moving averages. These tools are super important because they help me predict which way the market might move.
Platform Navigation: I’ve also become pretty good at navigating my trading platform. I can now look up stocks, analyze charts, set up trades, and use alerts without getting lost.
Staying Updated with News: Reading financial news has become a daily habit. I follow economic reports, earnings calls, and news about major companies because it helps me understand what’s going on in the market. This helps me make better decisions when it comes to my trades.
<br>
<h2>Professionalism</h2>
One of the most important lessons I’ve learned is how important it is to be professional when trading. This means sticking to a plan and always doing my research before making a trade. Being professional also means keeping track of my trades and learning from mistakes. It’s important to take trading seriously, even when I’m practicing, because this is how I’ll develop good habits that will help me when I start trading with real money.
