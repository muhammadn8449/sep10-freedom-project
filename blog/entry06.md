# Entry 6: MVP
##### 5/11/25

<h1>Content:</h1> 
<h3>How I made my MVP:</h3>
To build my MVP, I started by listing out the priority thing that I'm suppose to do. I set up a clear navigation bar with links that smoothly scroll to each section of the page. I formatted the text for readability and placed the images exactly where they support the content, storing them in a IMG folder to keep everything organized. I usally focused on the layout, navigation, and the visuality.

<h1>Challenges and Takeaways</h1>
<h2>Challenging</h2>
<h3>One of the hardest parts of making my MVP was staying on schedule. I had a tough time picking a day or time to finish certain tasks because I’d either forget or it felt too hard to start. It made things take longer than they should have, but it showed me that I need to plan better and stay more organized next time.</h3>

<h2>Takaways</h2>
<h3>A big takeaway from building my MVP is that staying organized and managing my time is just as important as the actual work. If I can build better habits around planning and following through, I’ll be able to finish projects faster and with less stress.</h3>

<h1>Source:</h1>
<h3>I used <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to build my MVP, specifically for creating the navigation bar and using the container and container-fluid classes to help with layout and spacing.</h3>

<h1>EDP</h1>
<h3>Right now, I'm still working on a few parts of my project website.. I need to finish the innovation section, the tool section where I talk about using A-Frame, and the container part that helps organize the website so it works well on both laptops and phones. </h3>

<h1>Skill:</h1>
<h3>I’m developing skills that help me outside of this project too, like time management and staying organized. I’ve learned that planning things out and following a schedule can make a big difference, not just for school work but for anything I need to get done. I also got better at problem-solving and paying attention to detail, especially when setting up layouts and using tools like Bootstrap. </h3>
