<h1>Content</h1>
<p>For my trading content, I’ve decided on the topic of trading because it’s a broad subject that allows me to explore many different aspects of the financial markets. Trading is important because it’s how people and institutions buy and sell stocks, currencies, commodities, and more to make profits. I want to talk about how trading works, the different types of trading, like day trading or long-term investing, and how people can get involved. It’s a topic that impacts the economy and people’s finances, which is why I think it’s important to focus on. As a backup, I could talk about why people choose to trade or how the markets have changed over time. Both of these are still about trading but would give different perspectives on the same topic. By focusing on trading itself, I can cover a range of ideas and dive deeper into what makes it such an essential part of the financial world.</p>

<p>Trading is essentially the buying and selling of financial assets, such as stocks, currencies, or commodities, with the goal of making a profit. There are different styles of trading depending on how quickly you want to buy and sell. For example, scalping involves making very fast trades, often within minutes, to take advantage of small price changes. <strong>Day trading is when all your trades are completed within a single day which is also called Short-Term Assests.</strong> <strong>For people who prefer to hold onto assets a little longer, swing trading allows traders to keep their investments for several days or weeks to profit from larger price movements.</strong> Lastly, position trading is more like investing, where traders hold onto assets for months or even years which is also called Long-Term Assest. Each of these methods requires different levels of risk and time commitment, making trading a versatile option for people with different goals and strategies.</p>

<h1>Engineering Design Process</h1>
<p>I’m currently in a more advanced stage of learning how to trade, but I’m feeling a bit apprehensive about starting to invest. I’ve covered a lot of material, such as understanding stock trends, market analysis, and trading strategies, but I worry that I haven’t fully connected all the dots yet. It’s like I’m in the “testing and refining” phase of the engineering design process, but I’m hesitant to move forward because I don’t feel completely ready. <strong>With only about two hours each day after school to practice, I’m concerned that this isn’t enough to solidify my understanding.</strong> I want to ensure I’m fully prepared before I start trading for real. The next stage is to start when school ends because I’ll have more time to dive deeper into what I’ve learned, practice, and eventually gain the confidence to start investing. It’s important for me to feel like I have a solid grasp of the concepts before taking that next step.</p>

<h1>Skills</h1>
<p>Skills that I have developed over the few past months is by <strong>Watching Videos, Analyzing The Platform, and Reading The News</strong></p>
<h3> Watching Videos</h3>
<p>Watching videos about trading has been incredibly beneficial for my learning process. Platforms like YouTube offer a wealth of resources, where I can find tutorials, strategy breakdowns, and market analysis from experienced traders. Channels that focus on technical analysis and trading psychology have helped me grasp essential concepts and apply them to my own trading practices. For example, videos that explain how to read charts and use indicators in real-time make the information much more relatable and easier to understand.</p>

<h3>Analyzing The Platform</h3>
<p>One skill I’ve accomplished in my trading journey is mastering how my trading platform works. I’ve taken the time to learn how to navigate its features, understand each chart, and use various indicators effectively. This knowledge has been crucial for making informed trading decisions. By familiarizing myself with the platform, I can analyze market trends and set up my trades more efficiently, ultimately enhancing my trading experience.</p>

<h3>Reading The News</h3>
<p>Another important development for me has been learning to read and interpret news that impacts the stock market. Before I started actively stock assets, I didn’t pay much attention to the news or its effects on stock prices. Now, I understand the significance of economic reports, company earnings, and global events. By keeping up with relevant news, I can better grasp what drives market movements, whether it’s a new product launch or a shift in economic policy. This awareness helps me make more informed decisions about my trades.</p>
