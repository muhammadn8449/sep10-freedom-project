# Entry 4: Aframe
##### 03/02/2025

### Context: 
I chose to explore Aframe, which is an awesome open source framwork for creating virtual reality experiences. It makes building 3D scenes by using HTML. I tinkered with their different features on aframe, likeing changing te background color, making different shapes, positionin them differently.

### Created 3D scene with several elements:
<ul>
<li>A blue box positioned at -1 0.5 -3, rotated 45 degrees, and colored #4CC3D9.</li>

<li>A red sphere positioned at 0 1.25 -5 with a radius of 1.25 and colored #EF2D5E.</li>

<li>A yellow cylinder positioned at 1 0.75 -3 with a radius of 0.5, a height of 1.5, and colored #FFC65D.</li>

<li>A green plane positioned at 0 0 -4, rotated -90 0 0, with a width of 4 and a height of 4.</li>

<li>Another green plane serving as the ground, rotated -90 0 0, with a height of 20 and a width of 20.</li>
</ul>

### Source: 
<p>I watched a youtube video to learn how to use A-frame, which provided a visual and practical introduction to the Framework. Additionally, I explored it's platform by going into the Docs section, where I tried out their sample code and learned through hands-on experimentation</p>

### Skills:
<h3>3D Graphics & Design skills:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This skill I developed helped me be bring virtual worlds to life by postioning ans shaping objects in a 3D space. Learning how to use shadows, ligthing, textures, and materials makes scenes more realistic.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Virtual Reality Development skill:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This skill I developed focuses on making VR experiences interactuve and engaging. Understanding camera controls and user interactions help create realistic movement andd responses. </li>
</ul>
