<a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/history-of-trading/"><stong>Trading</strong></a> has come a long way since the 1800s, when everything was done in person and required a lot of manual work. Nowadays, it’s completely digital, and platforms like <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/">TradingView</a> , Robinhood, and Crypto.com make it accessible to anyone with an internet connection. For example, TradingView is great for analyzing charts and data, but the free version limits how many indicators and time frames you can use. This can make it hard to dive deep into technical analysis, which is essential for successful trading, as <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/">Investopedia</a> explains.

<a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/">Robinhood</a>, on the other hand, is perfect for beginners because it lets you buy fractional shares and even set up a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> for <strong>long-term investments</strong>. However, it doesn’t allow day trading, which makes it less useful for someone like me who prefers <strong>short-term</strong> trades. <a href="https://crypto.com/us">Crypto.com</a> stands out by offering over <strong>350 cryptocurrencies</strong>, including <strong>meme coins</strong>, along with rewards like cashback through their crypto debit cards. The downside is the <strong>U.S. restrictions</strong>, which can limit what you can do.
