<a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/history-of-trading/"><stong>Trading</strong></a> has come a long way since the 1800s, when everything was done in person and required a lot of manual work. Nowadays, it’s completely digital, and platforms like <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/">TradingView</a> , Robinhood, and Crypto.com make it accessible to anyone with an internet connection. For example, TradingView is great for analyzing charts and data, but the free version limits how many indicators and time frames you can use. This can make it hard to dive deep into technical analysis, which is essential for successful trading, as <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/">Investopedia</a> explains.
<br>
<a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/">Robinhood</a>, on the other hand, is perfect for beginners because it lets you buy fractional shares and even set up a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> for <strong>long-term investments</strong>. However, it doesn’t allow day trading, which makes it less useful for someone like me who prefers <strong>short-term</strong> trades. <a href="https://crypto.com/us">Crypto.com</a> stands out by offering over <strong>350 cryptocurrencies</strong>, including <strong>meme coins</strong>, along with rewards like cashback through their crypto debit cards. The downside is the <strong>U.S. restrictions</strong>, which can limit what you can do.

### EDP(Engineering Design Process:
Right now, I’m in the research and planning stage of the engineering design process. I’m comparing platforms and deciding which one fits my needs for short-term trading. My next step will be the testing phase, where I’ll use a demo account or paper trading to practice. This approach allows me to learn without risking real money and helps me refine my strategies before moving to live trading.

Here's a turtorial of how to set up an account on tradingview and start trading with paper trading!

### Skill
Since my last entry, I’ve developed two key skills that apply both inside and outside of trading. First, I’ve improved my ability to analyze data by learning how to read charts and spot trends, like support and resistance levels, on TradingView. This skill is crucial for making informed decisions in trading but can also help in other areas. Second, I’ve gotten better at critical thinking by comparing platforms like Robinhood and Crypto.com. This has helped me figure out what’s useful and what’s unnecessary, a skill that’s valuable for decision-making in general.
