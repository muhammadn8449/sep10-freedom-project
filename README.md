# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **X**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **X**. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **X** in order to help me make my website.
You use HTML to build the structure of a website by adding things like text, images, buttons, and links using special tags like <h1> for headings or <p> for paragraphs. CSS is what you use to style that structure, like changing the colors, fonts, and layout to make your website look better and more organized. Bootstrap is a tool that helps make your site look nice and work well on phones and computers without writing a lot of codeâ€”it gives you ready-to-use styles and layouts. A-Frame lets you add 3D objects and even virtual reality scenes to your website using simple HTML-like code, so you can create things like 3D shapes or environments. GitHub is where you store all your website files online and even publish your site for free using something called GitHub Pages, which gives you a live link you can share with anyone.
