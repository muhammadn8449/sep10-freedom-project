<h1>Things I Tried</h1>
<ol>
  <li>I copied the code from their documents to get started with something, and shapes and white plane appeard</li>
  <li>I changed the background color from white to black and changed the plane color from white to green.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Challenges</h1>
<p>The most challenging thing is basically adding the right size shape onto another shape. For example, I want to make a snowman. Every circle shape I add, the size has to be reduced, which is very painful to do because you have to play around with the number for a decent quite of time until you get the exact measurement.</p>
<br>
<h1>Try Next:</h1>
<p>The next thing I will try to make is candle sticks because Trading is what my topic will be about. So probably make candle sticks and technical analysis of other markets.</p>

 ### The challenges part was that it wasn't easy to create a background trading platorm. And yet I still haven't done it.
